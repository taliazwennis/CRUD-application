# Building a Simple Anime Rating System: A React, NestJS, and PostgreSQL Application

This application was developed to provide users with the ability to manage anime series and their rankings efficiently. On the frontend, users can easily view all anime series details presented in a table format, the application also enables users to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, which allows them to create, edit, and delete anime series entries directly through the table interface. Furthermore, users have the flexibility to create new genres through the application, which can then be associated with the respective anime series.

## Technologies Used:

### Frontend

- React
- Material UI
- CSS

### Backend

- Nest.JS
- Fastify
- TypeORM
- Postgres
